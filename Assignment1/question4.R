#4. Create and store a vector that contains, in any configuration, the following:
 # i. A sequence of integers from 6 to 12 (inclusive)
#ii. A threefold repetition of the value 5.3
#iii. The number -3
#iv. A sequence of nine values starting at 102 and ending at the number that is the total
#length of the vector created in (3.)
seq1 <- 6:12  
rep_val <- rep(5.3, 3)  
num <- -3  
seq2 <- seq(102, length(sorted_vec), length.out = 9)  

final_vector <- c(seq1, rep_val, num, seq2)
